# Clawapps
Inspired by nurimoore's "clawapps", this is a remastered archive of apps from Flash and IGoogle.
#How to use
Go to the specific folder of the playform you are looking for. For example, you are looking for flash games (SWF) so you go to the "flash" folder.
There, you will see two folders: native and compiled. You will choose "compiled" if you are looking to run them in the web, or "native" if you are looking for the original platform.
